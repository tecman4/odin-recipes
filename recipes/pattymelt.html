    <p>A patty melt is basically a better version of the humble burger. While the round burger sits on top of a soft bun, the patty melt's patty is shaped into more of an oblong rectangle to fit toasted rye bread before being topped with plenty of Swiss cheese and caramelized onions. </p>
    <p>Regular burgers can get a bit boring after awhile. The solution? Our favorite dressed-up deli sandwich: The patty melt. Melty Swiss cheese and caramelized onions sit atop our ground beef patty, all sandwiched between perfectly toasted rye bread.</p>
    <h1>Ingredients</h1>
<ul>
    <li>3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil</li>
    <li>salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste</li>
    <li>1 medium onion, thinly sliced</li>
    <li>10 ounces button mushrooms, sliced</li>
    <li>8 tbsp. butter, divided, plus more as needed</li>
    <li>8 slices rye bread</li>
    <li>8 slices Swiss cheese</li>
    <li>1 1/2 lb. ground beef</li>


    </ul>
    <h1>Steps</h1>
<ol>
    <li>Form beef into 4 slightly oblong patties and season each one with salt and pepper.</li>
    <li>Salt and pepper the chicken well. Then don't bother with salting the flour and bread crumbs.</li>
    <li>In a large skillet over medium heat, melt 4 tablespoons butter. Add onion and cook until deeply golden, 20 minutes, stirring occasionally. Transfer onions to a plate.</li>
    <li>To same skillet, melt another 2 tablespoons butter over medium heat. Add patties and cook until desired doneness is reached, about 3 minutes per side for medium. Transfer patties to plate and tent with foil to keep warm. Drain fat.</li>
    <li>Return skillet to medium heat and melt remaining 2 tablespoons butter. Working in batches, toast slices of bread until golden, 2 minutes per side. Add more butter, as necessary.</li>
    <li>To assemble sandwiches, place one slice of Swiss cheese on a piece of bread, then a patty, caramelized onions, another slice of cheese, and top with a second piece of bread. Repeat with remaining sandwiches.</li>
